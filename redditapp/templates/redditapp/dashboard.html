        <h1>Welcome to the NS Sentiment Analysis Dashboard</h1>
        <p>
            This project seeks to understand the sentiments of Singaporeans serving National Service (NS) in Singapore, through the discussions in the r/NationalServiceSG subreddit. 
            It is an initial MVP intended to assist policy makers and defence executives in decision-making and policies formulation. 
            By scraping Reddit posts in the subreddit, a simple word frequency chart and word cloud is used to analysis and visualise their sentiments. 
            This MVP drives the potential to deep dive into our National Service menâ€™ sentiments through future analysis capabilities.
