# Reddit Analysis Project

This project seeks to understand the sentiments of Singaporeans serving National Service (NS) in Singapore, through the discussions in the r/NationalServiceSG subreddit. It is an initial MVP intended to assist policy makers and defence executives in decision-making and policies formulation. By scraping Reddit posts in the subreddit, a simple word frequency chart and word cloud is used to analysis and visualise their sentiments. This MVP drives the potential to deep dive into our National Service menâ€™ sentiments through future analysis capabilities.
